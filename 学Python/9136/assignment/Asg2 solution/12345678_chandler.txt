Hey
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Now that Rachel's gone?
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
You don't trust him?
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
Picturing that tree?
Where you going, Joe?
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Your thoughts? Plural?
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Great novels?
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Right behind you, big guy!
First I was afraid, I was petrified
Hi
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
