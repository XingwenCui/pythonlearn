 Lima.
 You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox".  Oh god! Oh!
 OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
 What, is he your pet rat?
 You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
 I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
 Thank you.
 Hey P
 Setting rat traps.
 No, no, to test his neck strength.
 Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
 Better think of a new name for him.
 I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
 Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
 Yeah. We have rat babies now.
 Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?
 Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
 Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
 Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
 It's gonna be ok.
 No, I think you're sweet.
