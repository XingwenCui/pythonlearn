 Would you stop staring at her?
 What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
 Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
 They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
  Take me home!
 Hey Rach!
 Ready for your birthday lunch?
 Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
 You were just being so nice to him!
 Right there! That was so fake!
 Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
 Does he?
 Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
 Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
 Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
 So this is what a stroke feels like.
 Hey!
 No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
 Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .
 Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
  Again, you're welcome.
 Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
