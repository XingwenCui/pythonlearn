 Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
 No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
 What?
  Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
 Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
 What are those?
 OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
 So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.
 Hey Mikey
 What are you doing?
 To kill Bob??
 No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
 I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Bob! Robert!  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
 I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
 Oh my god, we killed Bob!
 Suzie?
 Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
 I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
 No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
 Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
 Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
 Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
 Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
 No.  wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ...  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
 Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
 You must think I'm crazy.
 Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
  Hey
 Listen, I think I've left something here.
  No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
  Ooh, maybe that's him!
