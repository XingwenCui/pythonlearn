Hello
For what?
Is this your first appology?
What?
I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Huh. What's Tag's last name?
But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
It was Jones.
Gavin Mitchelle's office.
Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary.
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.   Yes?
Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?
Pleased to meet you.
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
Yeah, hey.
Nice party.
Look, I'll just give you this and go.
Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
I really mean it.
You don't mind?  Well, what do you know, it fits!
I'm not sure.
I do have feelings for you.
Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
